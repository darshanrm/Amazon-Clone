This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Overview
This is a Amazon-clone built with following tech-stack:<br />
1. ReactJs for Front-End<br />
2. Firebase Authentication for login functionality.<br />
3. Firebase firestore for realtime database.<br />
4. Firebase functions for backend API. <br />
5. Stripe Payment API for payment interface. <br />
and various other JS libraries.

I have hosted the front-end of this application on firebase <b>(https://clone-8a213.web.app/)</b><br />
You may host backend functionality on firebase using Blaze account type.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
<b>cd Amazon-Clone/</b> <br />
Run the above command <b>npm start</b> <br />
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `firebase emulators:start`
<b>cd Amazon-Clone/functions/</b> <br />
Run the above command <b>firebase emulators:start</b> <br />
Runs the backend APIs which are basically Firebase Functions.
